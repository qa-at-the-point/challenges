# Test Planning and Strategy Development

In this challenge, you need to come up with a Test Plan and Strategy for how you will test a website. Your plan and strategy can look and include whatever you think is best, but this is a common thing we do in Quality Engineering.

## Quality Engineer

Normally, this is a collaborative exercise with cross-functional members on your team (ie dev, product), but when you start out at a company, you need to be able to take something big - like a website you've never seen before - and break it down into pieces so you can prioritize and attack. This is an extreme example of course, but systems-level thinking is super important!

## Scenario

* An external team has just made changes to the application without proper testing ðŸ˜±
* Your manager has asked that you come up with quick strategy for how we can cover the most amount of functionality within a few hours.
* You've been given 10 minutes to document this plan so you can share it with the rest of your team who will be ready to help you test once you've given it to them

Unfortunately, you don't have any automated tests, but you have 10 people on your team who know the website pretty well

## Specs

* Application Under Test (AUT): [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login)
* Your manager has called out a few features that they don't care to test, due to time, off the top of their head:
  * Upgrade
  * Admin
  * Logout or Changing Password
  * Maintenance

* 40% of users use Chrome, 40% use Safari, and 20% use Firefox
* 75% of users use the desktop browsers, while 25% use mobile
* Admins mainly use the app for managing Employees
* Employess mainly use the app for requesting time off or punching in and out

## Goals

* Create a Test Plan doc that goes over what you want to test and how you will test it. Be prepared to share this with the group!
* You can do this in any tool or app, and in any format
